The talkbox application is an accessibility tool used to help people with verbal and communication
disabilities communicate. This is achieved by having the device have buttons associated with unique
sound files that are played when the buttons are pressed. In our first release we included 2 
applications: a simulator which will emulate the physical device that the code will run on, and
a configurator which communicates with the emulator/talkbox to change the button configuration.


About the talkbox simulator:
The talkbox simulator features an update log on the top and two types of buttons which aim to emulate
an actual talkbox on the bottom. The two types of buttons are as follows: a button set selector, which
allows you to change the types of buttons that are displayed. The second type of button is the audio
output button, these buttons aim to emulate the actual talkbox, and will play audio when pressed. The 
button set selector buttons are able to change between two sets of buttons that are configurable by the 
other program. Current we made it so that the two types of button sets are: Emotions and needs. Emotions
will play words like Happy and sad, and needs will play sounds like washroom or food.

About the Configurator:
The configurator allows users to change the buttons of the main application. This means that if the user
wants to change the types of words that will be included in the simulator, they can use this program to
do so. The program works by accepting files stored on the computer, and sending them to the device.


Release 1

This is the first official release of this software, we are aware that there will likely be bugs and limitations.
Further development will come to this software, and another release will come in early April.

Future releases will aim to make this program more integratable on a raspberry PI, and will try to improve the
configurator interface.
